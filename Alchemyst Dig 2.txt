Alchemyst Dig! Volume 2
by Alchemystics Design
--CREATIVITY IS CHEMISTRY--
All levels designed by Altermaven

This pack contains 24 caves, 6 intermissions
and 6 starts (if "select all caves" is off):
I
IV
VII
X
XIII
XVI

There are also five levels that adjust most
of the caves' "weirdness" and criteria. Go
for the gold! And the high score! You can
set these levels independent of cave start.

Premise can be found in the "Info" tab.

CAUTION: "Alchemyst Dig 2.bd" is a BDCFF file.
You need a Boulder Dash Cave File Format interpreter
in order to read this file and play this game.
One available interpreter is GDash.

----------------------------------------------
Gimmicks and titles:

I: "Warp Wrap"
Vertical wrapping.
The brick walls just above the space (or at
the very bottom if your interpreter doesn't
do wrap-scrolling) are enchanted.

II: "Seaweed"
Free the butterflies and they'll run into the amoeba
but don't go too fast or you'll extinguish it.

III: "Firewall"
Horizontal wrapping.

A1: "Ancient 1"
All "Ancient" levels use the monolith or 'Amoeba 2'
element. These amoeba are programmed to become
fireflies if they expand too far.
However, they become diamonds when smothered.

INT 1: "Trick"

IV: "Flutter"

V: "Cells"
Horizontal, vertical wrapping.

VI: "Flytrap"

A2: "Ancient 2"
Be mindful of the fireflies that exist

INT 2: "Escape"
Multiple Rockfords
The intermission is lost if all rockfords expire,
so you can 'sacrifice' one if it means escape.

VII: "Chase"

A3: "Ancient 3"
Be careful not to make an impossible situation.

VIII: "Vats"
Horizontal, vertical wrapping.

IX: "Pleothera"
Be careful, time limit is strict

INT 3: "Guard"
Displace the butterflies for a clear shot up.

X: "Spool"
Horizontal wrapping.

A4: "Ancient 4"
Modified amoeba threshold.
Be quick with the release and diamond grabs.
The monolith can convert to fireflies early!

XI: "Flutterprinter"
Modified magic wall.
Drop boulders into the walls, they turn into diamonds
and then into butterflies.

XII: "Racetrack"

INT 4: "Revenge"
Modified amoeba threshold.
Don't let the monoliths swell! Trap it with the diamonds
released from the butterflies!

XIII: "Gauntlet"
Careful when grabbing the diamonds, you don't want to
be cut off from your quota!

XIV: "Overgrowth"
Time the firefly release so they are not only out of the
way when the amoeba swells into boulders, but also that
the amoeba is not extinguished in the process.

A5: "Ancient 5"
Players of the NES Boulder Dash will be familiar with
this kind of smother level. Higher levels have firefly
hazards that need to be cleared as well.

XV: "Dash"
Again, be mindful of the time.

INT 5: "Nightmare"
Read the story for a haiku.

XVI: "Ziggy"
Vertical wrapping.

XVII: "Breakage"
Higher levels turn some fireflies into butterflies, and
the quota is increased to reflect.

A6: "Ancient Final"
Modified amoeba threshold.
Be aware that there are two monoliths to smother!

XVIII: "Daylight"
Don't get buried.

INT 6: "Waking"
The boulders can't be shoved. Time your drops.
