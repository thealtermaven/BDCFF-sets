# BDCFF-sets
Boulder Dash cavesets in the BDCFF text format.

You need a Boulder Dash Cave File Format interpreter to load and play these cavesets. GDash is one such interpreter. All cavesets created by ALCHEMYSTICS DESIGN. All caves designed by Altermaven.  
Creativity is chemistry!

You may tweak and change these cavesets provided you give me credit for the original material.  
There will be no official releases in the CLCK standalone format (d64). If you manage to, flag me down and send me the d64, and I'll post it with your credit.
