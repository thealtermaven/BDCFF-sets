Alchemyst Dig! Volume 5
by Alchemystics Design
--CREATIVITY IS CHEMISTRY--
All levels designed by Altermaven

This pack contains 23 caves, 5 intermissions
and 5 starts (if "select all caves" is off):
Cave A
Cave E
Cave I
Cave M
Vault In

There are also five levels that adjust most
of the caves' "weirdness" and criteria. Go
for the gold! And the high score! You can
set these levels independent of cave start.

Premise can be found in the "Info" tab.

CAUTION: "Alchemyst Dig 4.bd" is a BDCFF file.
