# BDCFF-sets
Boulder Dash cavesets in the BDCFF text format.

You need a Boulder Dash Cave File Format interpreter to load and play these cavesets. GDash is one such interpreter. All cavesets created by ALCHEMYSTICS DESIGN. All caves designed by Altermaven.  
Creativity is chemistry!

You may tweak and change these cavesets provided you give me credit for the original material.  
There will be no official releases in the CLCK standalone format (d64). If you manage to, flag me down and send me the d64, and I'll post it with your credit.  
---
To grab: Code > "Download ZIP", then drop them in a directory you have access to from your BDCFF interpreter. If you are planning on using GDash's /caves folder, make the folder /alchemystics and drop the files there. For the images to work they must be in the same directory. (You can also grab the most current bundle from the Releases section which has all three!)

10 Sep 2022: Alchemyst Dig 05: Adjusted time limit for INT 3 so there is now a slight leeway for error instead of having to be almost perfect for the clear.

29 Aug 2022: Alchemyst Dig 05: Cave C/3 was unsolveable due to a blocked exit. Since the next cycle of random fill RNG created solveable levels, the RNG was adjusted from 0/1/2/3/4 to 0/1/3/4/5. The requirements were not changed as the quota is flat across all levels. (h/t Dustin)

25 Aug 2022: Alchemyst Dig 05: Fixed a few extra issues. Cave D had a missing dirt element that was added, making L2 solveable. Cave F central stripe was removed, and the level should be solveable more reliably. Cave L was missing diamond scorings -- you can now get score in "Trip".
24 Aug 2022 15:44 EDT: Alchemyst Dig 05: Fixed an issue in Cave E that had incorrect timings. They are now the proper timings.
24 Aug 2022: Alchemyst Dig 05 has been released.

06 Feb 2022: Alchemyst Dig 04 has been released.

01 Sept 2021: Alchemyst Dig 03 has been released.

13 May 2021: Alchemyst Dig 02: Fixed an issue in III/4 that prevented escape from a section due to boulder push luck. Offending boulder removed. Fixed a missing element in Cave IV, which also solved a blocked-in Rockford in IV/4.

12 May 2021: Alchemyst Dig 02: Fixed weirdness in VII not having uniform delays. Fixed levels 3 and 4 of X having the wrong RNG seed, making the levels unable to be finished.

21 Apr 2021: Alchemyst Dig 01: Brushed up the accomodating textfile, fixed some weirdness in cave 25 "Falling", it's now not as impossible-feeling as the Impossibilium you are gathering. Cleaned up the remarks page, the url to this repo should be visible now
