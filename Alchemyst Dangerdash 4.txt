Release: 25 Sep 2023

This caveset has 20 caves and 5 intermissions,
and 4 starts if "Select All Caves" is disabled:

Cave A
Cave E
Cave I
Cave M

There are also five levels that adjust most
of the caves' "weirdness" and criteria. Go
for the gold! And the high score! You can
set these levels independent of cave start.

Premise can be found in the "Info" tab.

CAUTION: "Alchemyst Dangerdash 4.bd" is a
BDCFF file. You need a Boulder Dash Cave
File Format interpreter in order to read
this file and play this game.
GDash is recommended to use this caveset.

Oh wow, another year huh? That's probably
the longest gap between releases. I'll get
straight to the why: shit was kinda being
a little rough this year and I'm starting
to pursue two different avenues between the
concoctions of GDash sets. If you actually
looked at the Interesting Output Youtube,
I've actually began performing 'tweak sessions'
using the Roland AIRA T-8 Compact. But I
have plans to do more.

I'm also starting to eventually pick up on
the recording phase of games, so that's also
in the window.

The other avenue? NDA is stopping me, lol.

After the dilemma of the labrat, much to your
dismay, a brand new myriad had been discovered.
As per usual, you're the best one for the job.
Go in and haul some beautiful gems and deprive
another greedy ghostly bastard of his ill-gained
riches. They'll be better put to use anyway.
