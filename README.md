# BDCFF-sets
Boulder Dash cavesets in the BDCFF text format.

You need a Boulder Dash Cave File Format interpreter to load and play these cavesets. I recommend GDash as it is the target interpreter. All cavesets created by ALCHEMYSTICS DESIGN. All caves designed by Windbliss, formerly Altermaven.  
Creativity is chemistry!

You may tweak and change these cavesets provided you give me credit for the original material.  
There will be no official releases in the CLCK standalone format (d64). However, I am looking for individuals who will pack caves in CLCK standalone. If you manage to, flag me down and send me the d64, and I'll post it with your credit.

To grab: Peruse the Releases section to get the most up-to-date caveset pack in ZIP format. Unzip the contents into a folder accessable by your BDCFF interpreter of choice (such as GDash). May I suggest /alchemystics?

25 Sep 2024: Alchemyst DangerDash 04 has been released. It continues the general thematic of DangerDash 02. Any problems? Poke me.

02 Nov 2023: Alchemyst DangerDash 03: Adjusted a color in Cave N (Nambulite) to reduce intensity of the red for less eyestrain; adjusted the remark in cave X so it is actually spelt Xonotlite and not Xonotite :) Otherwise, no gameplay adjusts.

18 Sep 2023: Alchemyst DangerDash 03 has been released. If you read the story you will realise a similar theme in Alchemyst Dig 1. If you see the notes above each cave title, you'll understand why. This caveset uses RGB colors in lieu of the standard C64. It will become apparent once you link the colors to the mineral references...

29 Aug 2023: Alchemyst DangerDash 02: Fixed an inconsistency in the A-series to prevent the RNG from blocking Rockford in A/3. Revised the textfile of Dangerdash 01 to remove mentions of a non-existant "Alchemyst Dig! Vol.06".

29 Mar 2023: Alchemyst DangerDash 01: Changed the seed of H/2 so that the magic wall does not accidentally start itself due to the random fill. Cleaned up requisites in all levels of B -- only in B/5 you need all 60 diamonds. Adjusted seeds in various caves; increased timer in Outro 2 "Dexter" and adjusted requirements so perfection is not required, but you are still pressed for time. Adjusted seeds in few levels of K for more consistent smothers.

28 Mar 2023: Alchemyst DangerDash 01 has been released.
