# BDCFF-sets
Boulder Dash cavesets in the BDCFF text format.

You need a Boulder Dash Cave File Format interpreter to load and play these cavesets. GDash is one such interpreter. All cavesets created by ALCHEMYSTICS DESIGN. All caves designed by Altermaven.  
Creativity is chemistry!

You may tweak and change these cavesets provided you give me credit for the original material.  
There will be no official releases in the CLCK standalone format (d64). If you manage to, flag me down and send me the d64, and I'll post it with your credit.  
---
To grab: Code > "Download ZIP", then drop them in a directory you have access to from your BDCFF interpreter. If you are planning on using GDash's /caves folder, make the folder /alchemystics and drop the files there. For the images to work they must be in the same directory.

21 Apr 2021: Alchemyst Dig 01: Brushed up the accomodating textfile, fixed some weirdness in cave 25 "Falling", it's now not as impossible-feeling as the Impossibilium you are gathering. Cleaned up the remarks page, the url to this repo should be visible now
