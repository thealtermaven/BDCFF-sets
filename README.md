# BDCFF-sets
Boulder Dash cavesets in the BDCFF text format.

You need a Boulder Dash Cave File Format interpreter to load and play these cavesets. GDash is one such interpreter. All cavesets created by ALCHEMYSTICS DESIGN. All caves designed by Altermaven.  
Creativity is chemistry!

You may tweak and change these cavesets provided you give me credit for the original material.  
There will be no official releases in the CLCK standalone format (d64). However, I am looking for individuals who will pack caves in CLCK standalone. If you manage to, flag me down and send me the d64, and I'll post it with your credit.

To grab: Peruse the Releases section to get the most up-to-date caveset pack in ZIP format. Unzip the contents into a folder accessable by your BDCFF interpreter of choice (such as GDash). May I suggest /alchemystics?

02 Nov 2023: Alchemyst DangerDash 03: Adjusted a color in Cave N (Nambulite) to reduce intensity of the red for less eyestrain; adjusted the remark in cave X so it is actually spelt Xonotlite and not Xonotite :) Otherwise, no gameplay adjusts.

18 Sep 2023: Alchemyst DangerDash 03 has been released. If you read the story you will realise a similar theme in Alchemyst Dig 1. If you see the notes above each cave title, you'll understand why. This caveset uses RGB colors in lieu of the standard C64. It will become apparent once you link the colors to the mineral references...

29 Aug 2023: Alchemyst DangerDash 02: Fixed an inconsistency in the A-series to prevent the RNG from blocking Rockford in A/3. Revised the textfile of Dangerdash 01 to remove mentions of a non-existant "Alchemyst Dig! Vol.06".

29 Mar 2023: Alchemyst DangerDash 01: Changed the seed of H/2 so that the magic wall does not accidentally start itself due to the random fill. Cleaned up requisites in all levels of B -- only in B/5 you need all 60 diamonds. Adjusted seeds in various caves; increased timer in Outro 2 "Dexter" and adjusted requirements so perfection is not required, but you are still pressed for time. Adjusted seeds in few levels of K for more consistent smothers.

28 Mar 2023: Alchemyst DangerDash 01 has been released.

10 Sep 2022: Alchemyst Dig 05: Adjusted time limit for INT 3 so there is now a slight leeway for error instead of having to be almost perfect for the clear.

29 Aug 2022: Alchemyst Dig 05: Cave C/3 was unsolveable due to a blocked exit. Since the next cycle of random fill RNG created solveable levels, the RNG was adjusted from 0/1/2/3/4 to 0/1/3/4/5. The requirements were not changed as the quota is flat across all levels. (h/t Dustin)

25 Aug 2022: Alchemyst Dig 05: Fixed a few extra issues. Cave D had a missing dirt element that was added, making L2 solveable. Cave F central stripe was removed, and the level should be solveable more reliably. Cave L was missing diamond scorings -- you can now get score in "Trip".
24 Aug 2022 15:44 EDT: Alchemyst Dig 05: Fixed an issue in Cave E that had incorrect timings. They are now the proper timings.
24 Aug 2022: Alchemyst Dig 05 has been released.
