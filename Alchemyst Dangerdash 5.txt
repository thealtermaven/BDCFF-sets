This caveset has 20 caves and 5 intermissions,
and 4 starts if "Select All Caves" is disabled:

Cave A
Cave E
Cave I
Cave M

There are also five levels that adjust most
of the caves' "weirdness" and criteria. Go
for the gold! And the high score! You can
set these levels independent of cave start.

Premise can be found in the "Info" tab.

CAUTION: "Alchemyst Dangerdash 5.bd" is a

Nine months since the last act, eh? Time is
flying. This is probably the lab's last
contribution before the Big Thing I Can't Discuss
drops in your lap. How to make a proper tribute
celebration of forty-one years of the very glory
that is Boulder Dash? Get input from the fans ;)

Seriously though. If you've been keeping an eye
on *this* series, you'll discover something that
is quite fresh and yet familiar. I wonder what..

..But I can defintely say it's approved!! :D :D

The myriad of the long-forgotten Akh'ala Ma'lankah
is the next target of your dig. The keeper of the
deeds says recovering the hoard has become too
dangerous for general purposes, but since you're
skilled and all that, it's time to bust out the
moves and brave the depths..for fortune and glory!
