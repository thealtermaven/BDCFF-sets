Alchemyst Dig! Volume 4
by Alchemystics Design
--CREATIVITY IS CHEMISTRY--
All levels designed by Altermaven

This pack contains 20 caves, 5 intermissions
and 4 starts (if "select all caves" is off):
CAVE A
CAVE E
CAVE I
CAVE M

There are also five levels that adjust most
of the caves' "weirdness" and criteria. Go
for the gold! And the high score! You can
set these levels independent of cave start.

Premise can be found in the "Info" tab.

CAUTION: "Alchemyst Dig 4.bd" is a BDCFF file.

-----------------------------------------
The caveset is split up into five sections.
Only the start of the first four can be
chosen. "Select All Caves" should be off
in order to get the original experience.

If "Story" is enabled, you earn a haiku
when entering each intermission.
